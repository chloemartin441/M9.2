# CS408 - Lab9.2

## Overview

This project focuses on creating an interactive game called Bouncing Balls, where balls are generated to bounce around the screen. The player controls the evil circle (moves the circle using WASD). The goal is to move the evil circle, hit the bouncing balls and decrease the counter to 0 (until there are no more boucning balls).

## Running
Please fork over my public repo. From there select preview by hovering over the index.html. A window will pop up with the game, please copy the URL and put it in a browser of your choice. 

Use the WASD keys to control the evil circle and get the ball counter to 0.
